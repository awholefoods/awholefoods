							<h1>About Us</h1>
							<br />
							<h2>Our Mission</h2>

							<h2>Our Founder</h2>
								<p>AssWhole Foods was founded by Mr. Curt "Curtido" Fuqwad, Fresh Prince of Mill Aire. Not only did Mr. Fuqwad found the comapny, he presently serves as President, CEO, COO, CFO, CIO, CMO, Chariman of the Board, and as every seat on the Board of Directors.  But Mr. Fuqwad was not always this successful.  Growing up on the mean streets of Iowa, he started a gang at a young age and soon controlled the most K-Marts of any gang boss in the world.  Before long, he expanded his horizons to the tech sector, where he became the world's most sought-after professional database deleter.  Finally, with a mass fortune in hand, he was able to open his first AssWhole Foods store and thus fulfill a lifelong dream.</p>
